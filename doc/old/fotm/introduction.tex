\label{sec:Introduction}

This paper is an intentionally somewhat cryptic description
of the computation of various functions of polylines
and triangular meshes in $\Reals^3$,
and, especially, the derviatives of those functions.
It is not intended as a tutorial,
but rather as a set of notes for a reader who
already understands all of the ideas,
but just doesn't want to have to work out the
details of, for example, the gradient of the
area of a triangle with respect 
to the position of its vertices.
