\subsection{Split}

Splitting a simplex produces a refined complex by adding a new vertex
and subdivided some of the simplices.


Suppose $\Simplex{S}$ is a $d$-simplex
in the pure $n$-dimensional simplicial complex $\SimplicialComplex{K}_0$.
Let $\Vertex{V}$ be a vertex not in $\SimplicialComplex{K}_0$.
{\it Splitting $\Simplex{S}$ around $\Vertex{V}$}
produces a refined pure $n$-dimensional simplicial complex, $\SimplicialComplex{K}_1$:

$\SimplicialComplex{K}_1$ contains all the  $n$-simplexes of $\SimplicialComplex{K}_0$
that do not contain $\Simplex{S}$.

The simplexes that do contain $\Simplex{S}$ are split:
Let $\Simplex{T}$ be an $n$-simplex that contains $\Simplex{S}$.
Let $\Rsimplex$ be the $(n-d-1)$-simplex opposite $\Simplex{S}$
in $\Simplex{T}$.
(If $\Simplex{T} = \Simplex{S}$, then $\Rsimplex$ is the empty set.)
Let $\{ \Ffacet_0 \ldots \Ffacet_d \}$ be the
d $(d-1)$-simplex facets of $\Simplex{S}$.
$\SimplicialComplex{K}_1$ has
$d$ $n$-simplices formed from
$\Vertex{V}$, $\Rsimplex$, and
$\Ffacet_i$ where $i=0 \ldots d$.

This is also known as "placing a vertex" 
(See Lee~\cite[sec.~17.2]{lee-hdcg-17-2004}).

\subsection{Collapse}

Collapsing a simplex produces a reduced complex by mergng
the vertices of the simplex into a single new one.

Suppose $\Simplex{S}$ is a $d$-simplex
in the pure $n$-dimensional simplicial complex $\SimplicialComplex{K}_0$.
Let $\Vertex{V}$ be a vertex not in $\SimplicialComplex{K}_0$.
{\it Collapsing $\Simplex{S}$ to $\Vertex{V}$}
produces a reduced pure $n$-dimensional simplicial complex, $\SimplicialComplex{K}_1$:

$\SimplicialComplex{K}_1$ contains all the
$n$-simplices of $\SimplicialComplex{K}_0$ that share no vertices with $\Simplex{S}$.
Any $n$-simplex in $\SimplicialComplex{K}_0$ sharing more than one vertex
with $\Simplex{S}$ is ignored.
For every $n$-simplex in $\SimplicialComplex{K}_0$ sharing one vertex with $\Simplex{S}$,
$\SimplicialComplex{K}_1$ gets an $n$-simplex with $\Vertex{V}$ replacing the
shared vertex.
