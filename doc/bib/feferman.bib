Part I deals briefly with the thesis that category theory 
(or something like it) should provide 
the proper foundations of mathematics, 
in preference to current foundational schemes. 
An opposite view is argued here on the grounds 
that the notions of operation and collection 
are prior to all structural notions. 
However, no position is taken as to 
whether such are to be conceived 
extensionally or intensionally.}}

 abstract = {Does science justify any part of mathematics and, 
 if so, what part? These questions are related to the so-called
  indispensability arguments propounded, among others, 
  by Quine and Putnam; 
  moreover, both were led to accept significant portions
  of set theory on that basis. 
  However, set theory rests on a strong form of Platonic realism 
  which has been variously criticized 
  as a foundation of mathematics and 
  is at odds with scientific realism. 
  Recent logical results show that it is possible 
  to directly formalize almost all, if not all, 
  scientifically applicable mathematics in a formal system that 
  is justified simply by Peano Arithmetic 
  (via a proof-theoretical reduction). 
  It is argued that this substantially 
  vitiates the indispensability arguments.},

abstract={Both the constructive and predicative approaches 
to mathematics arose during the period of what was felt to be a 
foundational crisis in the early part of this century. 
Each critiqued an essential logical aspect of 
classical mathematics, namely concerning the unrestricted use 
of the law of excluded middle on the one hand, 
and of apparently circular ``impredicative'' definitions 
on the other. 
But the positive redevelopment of mathematics along constructive, 
resp. predicative grounds did not emerge as really viable 
alternatives to classical, set-theoretically based mathematics 
until the 1960s. 
Now we have a massive amount of information, 
to which this lecture will constitute an introduction, 
about what can be done by what means, 
and about the theoretical interrelationships 
between various formal systems 
for constructive, predicative and classical analysis.}}
