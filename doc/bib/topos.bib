@book{maclane-1998-working-mathematician,
abstract = {{Categories for the Working Mathematician 
provides an array of general ideas useful 
in a wide variety of fields.  Starting from the foundations, 
this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor,
natural transformation, and duality.  
The book then turns to adjoint functors, 
which provide a description of universal constructions, 
an analysis of the representations of functors 
by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating 
direct and inverse limits.  These categorical concepts are 
extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, 
which include many applications of the basic existence theorem 
for adjoint functors.  The categories of algebraic systems are 
constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterized 
by Beck's theorem.  After considering a variety of applications,
the book continues
with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions.  
This second edition includes a number of revisions and 
additions, including two new chapters on topics of active 
interest.  One is on symmetric monoidal categories and braided 
monoidal categories and the coherence theorems for them.  
The second describes 2-categories and the higher dimensional 
categories which have recently come into prominence.  
The bibliography has also been expanded to cover some of the 
many other recent advances concerning categories.}},
