{\citeAuthorYearTitle{Thurston:1994:Proof}}
{}
On the most fundamental level, the foundations of mathematics are much shakier
than the mathematics that we do. Most mathematicians adhere to foundational
principles that are known to be polite fictions. For example, it is a theorem that
there does not exist any way to ever actually construct or even define a well-ordering
of the real numbers. There is considerable evidence (but no proof) that we can get
away with these polite fictions without being caught out, but that doesn’t make
them right. Set theorists construct many alternate and mutually contradictory
``mathematical universes'' such that if one is consistent, the others are too. This
leaves very little confidence that one or the other is the right choice or the natural
choice. {\Godel}’s incompleteness theorem implies that there can be no formal system
that is consistent, yet powerful enough to serve as a basis for all of the mathematics
that we do.

Quote and paraphrase from 
\citeAuthorYearTitle{Ferreiros:2008:Crisis}.

G\"{o}ttingen/modern 
(Gauss, Dirichlet, Riemann, Dedekind, Cantor, Hilbert)
vs
Berlin, Paris (Kronecker, Weierstrauss)

Dissents from modern approach by Cantor and Riemann.

'Modern' approach:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dirichelet's 'arbitrary' functions
\item infinite sets and higher infinities
\item ``thoughts in place of calculations'' (Dirichelet)
\item structures characterized axiomatically.
\item purely existential methods of proof.
\end{itemize}

Early example: Dedekind (1871) Algebraic Number Theory,
Number Fields. Ideals.
 (``An ideal I in a ring R is a subset 
 such that the sum and difference of any two elements of I 
 and the product of any element of I with any element of R 
 are also in I.~\cite{sep:DedekindFoundations})
Existential proof of unique prime factorization for
ideals in any ring jof algebraic integers.
Kronecker complains about ability to \textsl{calculate}
(or \textsl{construct})
either ideals of their factors.
Dedekind: concrete problems require 
'more delicate computational techniques'~\cite{Ferreiros:2008:Crisis},
but conceptual theory is important.
Note similarity to Riemann's treatment of $\Space{C}$.
1867--1872

Wierestrauss: analytic functions via explicit power series;
Riemann: analytic functions satisfy differentiability condition.
$\Rightarrow$ Weierstrauss examples of nowhere differentiable
continuous functions.

Weierstrauss: function as analytical expression 
(how close is this to function as procedure?);
Riemann, Dedekind, Direchelet: function as single-valued relatio.
'Right framework'' for continuity and integration.
Called the \textit{conceptual approach} in 1800s math.

Kronecker disbelief in Bolzano-Weierstrauss thm.
(every infinite bounded set in $\Space{R}$ 
has an accumulation point);
accumulation pt can't be constructed from $\Space{Q}$.

Cantor's proofs in set theory ``quintessential examples
of modern methodology of existential proof''; 
attacks on Kronecker 1883.
Kronecker 1887 paper on foundational views.

Hilbert: axiomatic method in geometry 1899.

Cantor, Russell, Zermelo: circa 1900, paradoxes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item set theoretic: assumption of existence of certain sets
  leads to contradiction.
  \item semantic: truth and definability
\end{itemize}

Cantor diagonal argument:
\hfill\break
$\OneToOne$ map between binary sequences ($2^{\Space{N}}$)
and $[0,1]\subset\Space{R}$
Does that need a proof?
What about finite sequences vs trailing $1$s? 
\hfill\break
Then assume existence of a $\OneToOne$  
map between $2^{\Space{N}}$s 
and $\Space{N}$,
without any explicit construction.
Construct an explicit missing sequence 
for any candidate $\OneToOne$ map,
by flipping the $i$th bit in the $i$th sequence,
thus a contradiction?
So $\mathfrak{c} = \card(2^{\Space{N}}) 
= \card(\Space{R})$ must be greater than 
$\aleph_0 = \card(\Space{N})$. 
\hfill\break
Claim this can be extended to any set $\Set{S}$,
proving 
$\card(\Set{S}) < \card(2^{\Set{S}})$,
including 
$\card(\Space{R}) < \card(2^{\Space{R}})$?
Doesn't seem obvious.
\hfill\break
How does all this play with 
the Hilbert hotel paradox?~\cite{wiki:HilbertHotel}
(Problem with Hilbert hotel is 
always space for new customer, if everybody moves one room up,
but infinite time required to make that space.)

Question $1$ for Cantor:
\hfill\break
Are there any cardinals other than 
$\card(\Space{N})$ and 
$\card(\Space{R})$?

Question $2$ for Cantor (Continuum hypothesis aka CH):
\hfill\break
Are there any cardinals between
$\card(\Space{N})$ and 
$\card(\Space{R})$?

Implicit of axiom of choice (AOC) used to 'prove' 
well ordering (WO) of cardinals.
('Cardinals' not clearly defined.
Should it be equivalence classes of sets where
equivalence means 'there exists'/'we can construct'
a $\OneToOne$ mapping.)
\hfill\break
Well ordering used to show 'scale' of infinite cardinals
$\aleph_0, \aleph_1, \ldots$. (Is this countable?)
\hfill\break
Continuum hypothesis: 
$\mathfrak{c} = \card(2^{\Space{N}}) 
> \card(\Space{R}) = \aleph_1$
(and there are no cardinalities in between).

Zermelo axioms of set theory, including AC.
Start from axioms defining initial universe:
empty set and $\Space{N}$.
Then set operations including predicated subsets,
'finessing' the contradiction of the
cardinality of the set of all cardinalities,
set of all sets,
sets of all sets not containing themselves, 
\ldots.
\hfill\break
'\ldots more fuel for criticism \ldots.'
Weyl and Skolem improvements by basing it on 1st order logic.
(But doesn't a first order language require sets,
eg, a set of atomic symbols?)

P.~$60$ $2$nd paragraph (Skolem's paradox):
\hfill\break
What's the difference between $\Set{A} \sim \PowerSet{\Set{A}}$ 
($\card(\Set{A})=\card(\Set{\PowerSet{\Set{A}}})$
 'externally' vs 'internally'?

\textsf{G\"{o}del's incompleteness theorems:}
don't follow completely.

\textsf{Postscript on second-order logic:}
``second-order logic cannot be axiomatized effectively.''
Don't follow much of argument.

\textsf{Elimination of the law of the excluded middle:}
\hfill\break
LEM implies (for Hilbert) completed infinity (?).
\hfill\break
Heyting arithmetic (HA) excludes LEM;
any true statement in PA (Peano arithmetic) 
(and many other arithmetic systems)
can be translated into
a true statement in HA.
\hfill\break
This (somehow) implies that a finite consistency proof
of PA would not eliminate completed infinity.

\textsf{The elusiveness of Canotr's continuum problem:}
\hfill\break
Hilbert's program can't solve the continuum problem.

Examines admittedly limited and contradictory evidence
of G\"{o}del's platonist/realist/objectivist view of
mathematics: abstract mathematical entities exist outside 
of anybody's thinking about them;
undecidable propositions are in fact true or false, we just don't
know (?).
Also considers whether G\"{o}del concealed these views and 
why.~\cite[ch~7 ``Kurt G\"{o}del: conviction and caution'']{Feferman:1998:LightOfLogic}

Incompleteness theorem uses self-referential statement
equivalent to [this statement cannot be 
proved].~\cite[p~156]{Feferman:1998:LightOfLogic}

Self-referential paradoxes 'resolved' by 
``\ldots 'false statement in [language] B' cannot be expressed in
B, and so [is a] \ldots statement \ldots in some other 
language''.~\cite[p~157]{Feferman:1998:LightOfLogic}

G\"{o}del refers to 
Tarski~\cite{Tarski1944:SemanticTruth,Tarski:1983:LogicEtc} 
for justification in 1965 version 
of this work.~\cite{Godel:1986:CollectedWorksI}
 
(Can we construct a language that can express 
or evaluate the truth of 
its own statements? 
Is non-halting evaluation a way out of paradoxes?)

``Thus if truth of number theory \textit{were}
definable within itself, one could find a precise version of the
Liar statement, giving a contradiction.
It follows that truth is not so definable.
But provability in the system \textit{is} definable,
so the notions of provability and truth must be distinct.
In particular, if all provable sentences are true,
there must be true non-provable sentences.
The self-referential construction applied to provability
(which \textit{is} definable) instead of truth then 
leads to a specific example of an undecidable 
sentence.''~\cite[p~159]{Feferman:1998:LightOfLogic}

\item The formula $\neg P$ is defined as $P\Rightarrow \bot$,

\item There is no proof of $\bot$

What is a 'function' here?

Analysis examples too detailed and lacking motivation

of intervals in $\Space{Q}$~\cite{Bridger:2019}.

Intermediate value theorem C: 
``If $f$ is a continuous real-valued mapping 
on the closed interval $[0,1]$ such that $f(0)⋅f(1)<0$, 
then there exists $x$ such that $0<x<1$ and $f(x)=0$.

Proof requirement:

shows that $f(x)=0$.''~\cite{sep:ConstructiveMathematics}

Not constructive because it requires
``lesser limited principle of omniscience (LLPO)''.

Intermediate value theorem D:
``If $f$ is a continuous real-valued mapping

Can be proved constructively.

Stronger intermediate value theorem:
``Let $f$ be a continuous real-valued mapping

Suppose also that $f$ is locally nonzero,

Then there exists $x$ such that $0<x<1$ and $f(x)=0$.''

Section 3.1: Intuitionist (Brouwer)

``Brouwer was not the clearest expositor of his ideas, 
as is shown by the following quotation:

Mathematics arises when the subject of two-ness, 
which results from the passage of time, 
is abstracted from all special occurrences. 
The remaining empty form [the relation of n to n+1] 
of the common content of all these two-nesses 
becomes the original intuition of mathematics 
and repeated unlimitedly creates new mathematical subjects. 
(quoted in Kline [1972], 1199–2000)''

(Nederlands to Deutsch to English?)

``According to [Brouwer’s] view and reading of history, 
classical logic was abstracted 
from the mathematics of finite sets and their subsets. \ldots 
Forgetful of this limited origin, 
one afterwards mistook that logic 
for something above and prior to all mathematics, 
and finally applied it, without justification, 
to the mathematics of infinite sets. 
This is the Fall and original sin of set theory, 
for which it is justly punished by the antimonies. 
It is not that such contradictions showed up that is surprising,
 but that they showed up at such a late stage of the game. 
 (Weyl [1946])''
 
Weyl may have worked out a description of
$\Space{R}$ without (uncountable) infinity or
axiom of choice?

``An implication ($A \Rightarrow B$) is not equivalent 
to a disjunction ($\lnot A \vee B$), 
and neither are equivalent to a negated conjunction 
($\not (A \wedge \lnot B$)). 
In practice, constructive mathematics may be viewed 
as mathematics done using intuitionistic 
logic.''\cite{iep:ConstructiveMathematics}

Hilbert vs Brouwer circa 1900: 
non-constructive existence theorems via contradiction.

Usual example: Prove $\exists a,b \notin \Space{Q}$
such that $a^b \in \Space{Q}$. \hfill\break
Non-constructive: Use law of excluded middle.
If $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}} \in \Space{Q}$, done.
If not, consider ${\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}}^{\sqrt{2}}$.
\hfill\break
Constructive: consider $a=\sqrt{2}$ and $b=\log_2(9)$.

\begin{plSection}{Martin-L\"{o}f}
\label{sec:Martin_Lof_IEP}

``However he soon revisited foundations in a different way, 
which harks back to Russell's type theory, 
albeit using a more constructive and less logicist approach. 
The basic idea of Martin-Löf's theory of types (Martin-Löf, 1975) 
is
that mathematical objects all come as types, 
and are always given in terms of a
type (for example, one such type is that of functions 
from natural numbers to
natural numbers), due to an intuitive understanding 
that we have of the notion
of the given type.

The central distinction Martin-Löf makes is that 
between proof and derivation.
Derivations convince us of the truth of a statement, 
whereas a proof contains the data necessary for computational
(that is, mechanical) verification of a proposition. 
Thus what one finds in standard mathematical textbooks are
derivations; 
a proof is a kind of realizability (c.f. Kleene, 1945) and links
mathematics to implementation (at least implicitly).

The theory is very reminiscent of a kind of cumulative hierarchy. 
Propositions can be represented as types 
(a proposition's type is the type of its proofs),
and to each type one may associate a proposition 
(that the associated type is not empty). 
One then builds further types by construction on already existing
types.''

\label{sec:Constructivism_Wikipedia}

\cite{wiki:ConstructivismPhilosophyOfMathematics}

Usually drop law of excluded middle 
($P \vee \lnot P$).\cite{wiki:LawOfExcludedMiddle}
It is possible that both $P$ and $\lnot P$ are not provable,
so $P \vee \lnot P$ is not provable.

But keep law of non-contradiction
($\lnot ( P \wedge (\lnot P))$).~\cite{wiki:LawOfNoncontradiction}
In other words, it is impossible to prove both.

Witnesses: Proving $\exists _{x\in \Set{X}}P(x)$ requires
constructing a specific $a \in \Set{X}$ such that $P(a)$ is true; 
$a$ is a \textit{witness} for $\exists _{x\in \Set{X}}P(x)$.

In constructive 
analysis~\cite{wiki:ConstructiveAnalysis,

varieties of constructionism are divided by
what sort of countable $\rightarrow$ countable functions can be 
constructed?~\cite{wiki:ConstructivismPhilosophyOfMathematics}

\begin{plSection}{Choice sequences}
\label{sec:Choice_sequences}

\begin{description}
\item[Law-like] determined completely (somehow?),
eg, $\Space{N}$ or functions $\Space{N} \mapsto \Space{N}$,
functions from the first $k$ elements of the sequence to 
$\Space{N}$.
(How is this different from a computable function?)
\item[Lawless] only a finite prefix determined at any point.
Example is rolls of a die. (Very dubious\ldots.)
\end{description}

Axioms 
(Are these only for lawless sequences?
They don't seem 'constructive' to me\ldots):
\begin{description}
\item[open data] Let $\alpha \in n$ mean that the first items
in the choice sequence $\alpha$ match the finite sequence $n$.
Then for any predicate $A$,
$A(\alpha )$ implies  $\exists n$ such that
$\alpha \in n$ and $\forall \beta \in n$ we have $A(\beta )$.
In other words, the truth of any predicate on a sequence can be
determined from a finite prefix.
\item[density] $\forall n\,\exists \alpha [\alpha \in n]$.
There exists some sequence that has any given finite prefix.

(Starts with a given enumeration of (say) binary expansions of

\begin{plSection}{Axiom of choice}

One interpretation of 'constructive' is
'provable in $\textsf{ZF}$ set theory without the axiom of 
choice.'~\cite{iep:SetTheory,wiki:AxiomOfChoice}
(See \cref{sec:Zermelo-Fraenkel-set-theory} for \textsf{ZF}.)
But \textsf{ZF} may be considered 'not constructive'
itself.

In some set theories, the axiom of choice implies
the law of excluded middle; in others it doesn't.
When it does, constructionists use weaker versions
that don't imply $P \, \wedge \, \lnot P$.
So some constructionists restrict themselves
