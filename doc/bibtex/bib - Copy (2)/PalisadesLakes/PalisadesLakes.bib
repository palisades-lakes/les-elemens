abstract={Given a set of non-intersecting (except at endpoints) 
line segments in the plane we want to compute 
their Voronoi diagram. Although there are several algorithms for this problem
in the literature [Yap87, For87, CS89, BDS+92, KMM90] 
nobody claims to have a correct implementation. 
This is due to the fact that the algorithms presuppose 
exact arithmetic and that the Voronoi diagram of segments 
requires to compute with non-rational algebraic numbers. 
We report about a detailed study of the numerical precision 
required for evaluating the geometric test exactly and 
about first experimental experiences. 
More specifically, we improve the precision bound implied 
by classical root separation results 
by more than two orders of magnitude 
and we compare the implementation strategies 
suggested by our theoretical results.},

is a relatively recent invention, and hence it is believed 
that a preliterate brain must adapt on the fly, so to speak,
in learning how to process written words, rather than 
being able to rely upon evolutionarily ancient 
modifications of the visual system pathways. 
Dehaene et al. (p. 1359, published online 11 November) 
examined the neural response to a range of visual stimuli
in three groups: illiterate adults, adults who learned
to read as children, and adults who learned to read 
as adults. Reading induced a greater facility
in processing horizontally oriented stimuli 
at early stages in the visual pathway 
and was also associated with the appearance 
of an area specialized for words. This gain
of function appeared to occur 
at a cost{\textemdash}the area in the temporal cortex 
devoted to face processing shrank.
Does literacy improve brain function? 
Does it also entail losses? Using functional magnetic 
resonance imaging, we measured brain responses 
to spoken and written language, visual faces, houses, 
tools, and checkers in adults of variable literacy 
(10 were illiterate, 22 became literate as adults, 
and 31 were literate in childhood). 
As literacy enhanced the left fusiform activation evoked 
by writing, it induced a small competition with faces 
at this location, but also broadly enhanced visual responses 
in fusiform and occipital cortex, extending to area V1. 
Literacy also enhanced phonological activation to speech 
in the planum temporale and afforded a top-down activation 
of orthography from spoken inputs. Most changes occurred 
even when literacy was acquired in adulthood, emphasizing 
that both childhood and adult education can profoundly 
refine cortical organization.},

abstract="We develop the theoretical foundation of a new
representation of real numbers based on the infinite composition 
of linear fractional transformations (lft), equivalently the
infinite product of matrices, with non-negative coefficients. 
Any rational interval in the one point compactification of the 
real line, represented by the unit circle S1, is expressed as 
the image of the base interval [0, âˆž] under an lft. A 
sequence of shrinking nested intervals is then represented 
by an infinite product of matrices with integer coefficients 
such that the first so-called sign matrix determines an interval 
on which the real number lies. The subsequent so-called digit 
matrices have non-negative integer coefficients and successively 
refine that interval. Based on the classification of lft's 
according to their conjugacy classes and their geometric 
dynamics, we show that there is a canonical choice of four sign 
matrices which are generated by rotation of S1 by Ï€/4.
Furthermore, the ordinary signed digit representation of real 
numbers in a given base induces a canonical choice of digit 
matrices."

However, set theory rests on a strong form of Platonic realism 
which has been variously criticized 
as a foundation of mathematics and 
is at odds with scientific realism. 
Recent logical results show that it is possible 
to directly formalize almost all, if not all, 
scientifically applicable mathematics in a formal system that 
is justified simply by Peano Arithmetic 
(via a proof-theoretical reduction). 
It is argued that this substantially

and of apparently circular ``impredicative'' definitions 
on the other. 
But the positive redevelopment of mathematics along constructive, 
resp. predicative grounds did not emerge as really viable 
alternatives to classical, set-theoretically based mathematics 
until the 1960s. 
Now we have a massive amount of information, 
to which this lecture will constitute an introduction, 
about what can be done by what means,

title={Back to the Future: Lisp as a Base for a Statistical Computing System},
abstract = {{The application of cutting-edge statistical methodology is limited by the capabilities of the systems in which it is implemented. In particular, the limitations of R mean that applications developed there do not scale to the larger problems of interest in practice. We identify some of the limitations of the computational model of the R language that reduces its effectiveness for dealing with large data efficiently in the modern era. We propose developing an R-like language on top of a Lisp-based engine for statistical computing that provides a paradigm for modern challenges and which leverages the work of a wider community. At its simplest, this provides a convenient, high-level language with support for compiling code to machine instructions for very significant improvements in computational performance. But we also propose to provide a framework which supports more computationally intensive approaches for dealing with large datasets and position ourselves for dealing with future directions in high-performance computing. We discuss some of the trade-offs and describe our efforts to realizing this approach. More abstractly, we feel that it is important that our community explore more ambitious, experimental and risky research to explore computational innovation for modern data analyses.}},

in proof theory from a neglected point of view. 
Proofs and their representations by formal derivations 
are treated as principal objects of study, 
not as mere tools for analyzing the consequence relation. 
Though the paper is principally expository, 
it also contains some material not developed in the literature. 
In particular, adequacy conditions on criteria 
for the identity of proofs (in section 1c), and 
a reformulation of Gödeľs second theorem in terms of the notion 
of canonical representation (in section 1d); 
the use of normalization, instead of normal form, 
theorems for a direct proof of closure under Church's rule 
of the theory of species [in sec 2a(ii)] 
and the uselessness of bar recursive functionals 
for (functional) interpretations of systems 
containing Church's thesis [in sec 2b(iii)]; 
the use of ordinal structures in a quantifier-free formulation 
of transfinite induction (in sec 3); 
the irrelevance of axioms of choice to the explicit realizability 
of existential theorems both for classical and 
for Heyting's logical rules (in sec 4c) and 
some new uses of Heyting's rules for analyzing 
the indefinite cumulative hierarchy of sets (in sec 4d); 
a semantics for equational calculi suitable 
when terms are interpreted as rules for computation 
[in Appl. Ia(iii)], and, 
above all, an analysis of formalist semantics and 
its relation to realizability interpretations (in App. Ic). 
A less technical account of the present point of view is in [21]."

abstract="In this paper we investigate an extension to 
Vuillemin's work on continued fraction arithmetic 
[Vuillemin 87, Vuillemin 88, Vuillemin 90], 
that permits it to evaluate the standard statistical distribution
functions. By this we mean: the normal distribution, 
the -distribution, the t-distribution, 
and, in particular, the F-distribution. T
he underlying representation of non-rational 
computable real numbers is also as continued fractions, 
in the style of Vuillemin. This permits arbitrary accuracy 
over a range of values. 
The number of terms of a continued fraction that are used 
by the implementation is dynamically controlled 
by the accuracy demanded of the final answer. 
The use of a modern lazy functional language - Haskell - 
has considerably eased the programming task. 
Two features are of note. Firstly, the type-class structure 
allows one to augment the varieties of numbers supported 
by the language. 
Secondly, the laziness inherent in the Haskell's semantics, 
makes it very straightforward to dynamically control 
the accuracy of the intermediate evaluations.",

provides an array of general ideas useful 
in a wide variety of fields. Starting from the foundations, 
this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor,
natural transformation, and duality. 
The book then turns to adjoint functors, 
which provide a description of universal constructions, 
an analysis of the representations of functors 
by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating 
direct and inverse limits. These categorical concepts are 
extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, 
which include many applications of the basic existence theorem 
for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are 
constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterized 
by Beck's theorem. After considering a variety of applications,
the book continues
with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions. 
This second edition includes a number of revisions and 
additions, including two new chapters on topics of active 
interest. One is on symmetric monoidal categories and braided 
monoidal categories and the coherence theorems for them. 
The second describes 2-categories and the higher dimensional 
categories which have recently come into prominence. 
The bibliography has also been expanded to cover some of the 
many other recent advances concerning categories.}},

abstract = {Saunders MacLane has drawn attention many times, 
particularly in his book Mathematics: Form and Function, 
to the system \{ZBQC\} of set theory of which the axioms are 
Extensionality, Null Set, Pairing, Union, Infinity, Power Set, 
Restricted Separation, Foundation, and Choice, 
to which system, afforced by the principle, TCo, 
of Transitive Containment, we shall refer as MAC. 
His system is naturally related to systems derived 
from topos-theoretic notions concerning the category of sets, 
and is, as MacLane emphasises, 
one that is adequate for much of mathematics. 
In this paper we show that the consistency strength 
of MacLane's system is not increased by adding the axioms 
of Kripke–Platek set theory and 
even the Axiom of Constructibility to MacLane's axioms; 
our method requires a close study of Axiom H, 
which was proposed by Mitchell; 
we digress to apply these methods to subsystems 
of Zermelo set theory Z, 
and obtain an apparently new proof 
that Z is not finitely axiomatisable; 
we study Friedman's strengthening KPP+AC of KP+MAC, 
and the Forster–Kaye subsystem \{KF\} of MAC, 
and use forcing over ill-founded models and 
forcing to establish independence results concerning \{MAC\} 
and KPP; 
we show, again using ill-founded models, 
that KPP+V=L proves the consistency of KPP; 
turning to systems that are type-theoretic in spirit or in fact,
we show by arguments of Coret and Boffa 
that \{KF\} proves a weak form of Stratified Collection, 
and that MAC+KP is a conservative extension of \{MAC\} 
for stratified sentences, from which we deduce that 
\{MAC\} proves a strong stratified version of KP; 
we analyse the known equiconsistency of \{MAC\} 
with the simple theory of types 
and give Lake's proof that 
an instance of Mathematical Induction is unprovable 
in MacLane's system; 
we study a simple set theoretic assertion—namely 
that there exists an infinite set of infinite sets, 
no two of which have the same cardinal—and 
use it to establish the failure of the full schema
of Stratified Collection in Z; 
and we determine the point of failure 
of various other schemata in MAC. 
The paper closes with some philosophical remarks.},

For twice the working precision our algorithms 
for summation and dot product are some 40% faster 
than the corresponding XBLAS routines 
while sharing similar error estimates. 
Our algorithms are widely applicable because 
they require only addition, subtraction, and multiplication 
of floating-point numbers in the same working precision 
as the given data. Higher precision is unnecessary, 
algorithms are straight loops without branch, 
and no access to mantissa or exponent is necessary.

abstract="Starting from the topological point of view 
a certain wide class of To-spaces is introduced 
having a very strong extension property for continuous functions 
with values in these spaces. It is then shown that all such spaces 
are complete lattices whose lattice structure determines 
the topology --- these are the continuous lattices --- and 
every such lattice has the extension property. 
With this foundation the lattices are studied in detail 
with respect to projections, subspaces, embeddings, 
and constructions such as products, sums, function spaces, 
and inverse limits. The main result of the paper is a proof that 
every topological space can be embedded in a continuous lattice 
which is homeomorphic (and isomorphic) to its own function space. 
The function algebra of such spaces provides mathematical models 
for the Church-Curry $\lambda$-calculus.",

In the general, convex set, version the barycentric coordinates

The measure is a density over smooth parts of the boundary, 
with density increasing with increasing Gaussian curvature, 
resulting in point masses (dirac delta functions) 
at isolated extrema. The boundary of a convex polytope has zero 
Gaussian curvature except at the extrema, so its 
barycentric coordinates reduce to a finite sum. Very neat.

it won't work as a way to interpolate 
over degenerate polytopes, for example, 
the terminal bins of a decision tree.},
